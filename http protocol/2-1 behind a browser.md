## What happens when you access a url on browser

1. when you open a website on browser, the request first goes to a DNS server, where it gets the actual ip address of the domain
2. after getting the ip address, the request is sent to the server on that ip address
3. the server will respond with some data based on the request
4. after browser receives response data it will render it for the user to view

## What is HTML
