Most common way to access a service is with domain/url, but TCP/IP uses ip address, DNS is a service that transforms domain to actual ip address
Computer has a mapping of common domain to ip address saved, it is used before a DNS server
DNS uses a hierarchy to manage its distributed database system, the DNS hierarchy (domain name space) is an inverted tree structure, the root domain sits at top of the tree
ie. when you check ip for example.com, it checks DNS for .com first, if not found then go up to root domain
